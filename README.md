# Udacity Portfolio Site
Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree â€“ Project 1: Build a Portfolio Site

Project Description:

Students are provided a design mockup as a PDF-file and must replicate that design in HTML and CSS.
Students will develop a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects they will complete through the course of the Front-End Web Developer nanodegree.
Once students have successfully replicated the design mockup, they are encouraged to continue tweaking and making customizations to the design to personalize it and make it their own.
